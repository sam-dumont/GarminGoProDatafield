# GarminGoProWidget

This datafield allows Garmin users to control their GoPro camera (versions 8 and above) directly from an activity.

It is currently only supporting Edge 840, 1040, 1050 and Explore 2 and select watches, because they are the only devices allowing touch interactions and System7 features.

I am currently experimenting with Edge Remote to see if it could be used to control the camera. Stay tuned.
